# VisualizingChaos
Final Project for Physics 5810 - Computational Physics

The final project will use some previously learned methods of solving dfferential equations in C++ to solve the damped, driven pendulum oscillator differential equation.
Then, the project will use PyGame to create a 2D visual representation of the pendulum system and display the chaotic behavior as well as a few plots for data analysis such as
phase-space plots, power spectrums, etc.
